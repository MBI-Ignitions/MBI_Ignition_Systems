## Introduction

Motorized Bike Ignition Systems (MBI) is an open-source project focused on developing high-quality ignition systems for motorized bikes. Our goal is the development of new CDI technology, tools for evaulating them, and providing open and closed source CDIs for motorized bike engines.

## Features

- **Reliability**: MBI ignition systems are designed for reliability, we overspec all parts and vet most of our designs before release for reliability.
- **Customization**: The project seeks to make it easy to custimize and modify the open-source designs for your own engines needs.
- **Compatibility**: Our ignitions are a drop in replacement for almost all stock motorized bike engines that use a standard magneto and magnet.
- **Open Source**: The entire project is open source, encouraging collaboration and innovation within the motorized bike community.

## Acquiring

There are a few ways you can go about acquiring a CDI. You can:
- Order your own boards (minimum of 5), components and equipment, then build them yourself. This is the cheapest option for small batches.
- Order your boards from an approved seller in your desired quantity, order components and equipment then build them yourself. This is cheaper for single board runs.
- Purchase a board and component kit (COMING SOON).
- Purchase a completed board. This is the easiest to get running out of the box.

## Updates

Since this is an open-source passion project, we are adding information when we find time to. The wiki will start to get more and more information as we build more testing equipment and gather more knowledge from the community. If you think that there's more to add then consider becoming a contributor or donating to the project!
