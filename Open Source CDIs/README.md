## Jaguar CDI
This is one of Jaguar's older designs, photos are openly found online. Credit to him on facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/michael.forrest.7798. Design is from [here](https://www.dragonfly75.com/motorbike/CDI/CDI-layout.jpg)

## Baker 
Jim Baker's design. This is his ultimate version with jumpers instead of a selector switch, and smaller 1N4007 diodes. Credit to him on facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/jim.baker.7927, he no longer builds them currently. 
One of his designs can be found online [here](https://www.blasterforum.com/media/zappy-cdi-coil-fired-adjustable-ignition.9499/full?d=1545531996)

## Rohmell
Pulled from the motorized bike forum. Design can be found [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmotoredbikes.com%2Fthreads%2Fcdi-upgrade.45720%2F&psig=AOvVaw3EV8G8pml-__hgrAlN-TIA&ust=1705089441070000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCIim86mP1oMDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)

## Design Principles
All of these designs follow the same principles:
- SCR to control the spark
- RC bank to control timing
- Diodes for rectification
- Resistor divider for further timing

Some designs also have themistors or thermal resistors. These are to change the timing depending the ambient temperature.
