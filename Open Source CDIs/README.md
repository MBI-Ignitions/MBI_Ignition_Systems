## Jaguar CDI
This is one of Jaguar's older designs, photos are openly found online.

## Baker 
Jim Baker's design. This is his ultimate version with jumpers instead of a selector switch, and smaller 1N4007 diodes.

## Rohmell
Pulled from the motorized bike forum. Most recent design before the images were pulled.

## Design Principles
All of these designs follow the same principles:
- SCR to control the spark
- RC bank to control timing
- Diodes for rectification
- Resistor divider for further timing

Some designs also have themistors or thermal resistors. These are to change the timing depending the ambient temperature.
